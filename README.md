## Project Overview

The NLS project aims to bridge the gap between humans and machines by providing a platform where programming can be conducted in a natural, intuitive manner. Our goal is to allow users to focus on logic and creativity rather than on complex syntax and coding structures.

## Vision and Mission

Our mission is to promote the widespread adoption of natural programming languages within the artificial intelligence community, research institutions, and academic environments. By enriching NLS, we aim to establish it as a viable alternative for the future of traditional programming languages.

## What is NLS?

Natural Programming Languages allow developers to construct programs, applications, and algorithms using human languages. Through our **NLS-ASSEMBLER**, users can create files with the `.nls` extension, facilitating the same functionalities and objectives as traditional code but utilizing natural language syntax. This approach eliminates the need for complex coding structures, making programming more accessible and intuitive.
